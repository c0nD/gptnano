Mini-Generative Pretrained Transformer

## Motivation:
The motivation behind doing this project is to explore AI and understand how these transformers actually work.
With AI models such as ChatGPT, Google BARD, etc popping up: making my own GPT model to explore the fundamentals
behind how they work seemed like a great project!

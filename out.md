Enter, two nobles, ALBANY and MORTIMER

ALBANY:
Aye, 'pon the morrow's dawn, such tales we'll weave,
Of valiant knights and damsels in reprieve.
The sun's warm blush, that colors eastern skies,
Shall find us armed in courage, no disguise.

MORTIMER:
Thy tongue doth flutter as a lark in spring,
Yet heed, dear Albany, the shadows bring,
A twisted tale, enwrapped in silent dread,
A tale not for the light, but dark instead.

ALBANY:
Speak on, brave Mortimer, reveal thine thought,
Let not these shadows dim the light we sought,
For in the heart of man, both light and dark,
Reside alike, a flame and fading spark.

MORTIMER:
Aye, that be true, we harbor both within,
The saint's pure heart, the sinner's secret sin.
Yet let us tread with caution on our quest,
Lest we awaken demons laid to rest.

ALBANY:
Thou speakest wisely, yet thy fear I spurn,
For in the crucible of trial we learn.
The dawn shall find us ready for the fray,
Unbowed, unbroken - come what may.

[They exit]

Exeunt
